* [Introduction](#introduction)

## Introduction
Specification of a program to manage the resources of a ecovillage in a cyclical closed-loop system.

Village resources are defined as:

* ðŸ’§ Water
* ðŸŒ± Food
* âš¡ Energy

Village resources are provides by **village components**, primarily:

* Houses
* Shared Infrastructure

Each individual house in the village can be thought of as a sub-component to the overall system with resources managed by [House Resource Management Module](./house-resource-management-spec.md).

Shared infrastructure components would vary from village-to-village based on unique needs, desires, and interests, but may consist of:

* Electrical vehicles and / or charging station
* A "common house", community spaces, or community center
* Centralized village power and electrical grid (may feed into wider municipal grid)
* Plumbing and waste-water treatment center (performed ecologically using centralized bio-gas digestion)

## Goals
* Assist in village planning.
* Allow village simulation.
* Assist in automation of resource management to free-up human time.
* Assist in village improvements, resource attainment efficiency, policy, and decision-making.
* Applicable to existing ecovillages such as [Dancing Rabbit Ecovillage](https://www.dancingrabbit.org/).

## Principles
The following principles should be observed by the system and guide overall design and decision making.

Each principle is not mutually exclusive, and may tie into other principles.

* **Universal**
  * Applicable to any geographic location or unique bio-regions.
* **Accessible**
  * Available to any person regardless of disability: deaf, blind, vision or hearing impaired, amputee.
* **Low Cost**
  * Financial cost to individuals should be minimized.
* **Global**
  * Applicable to any person, culture, or language in the world.
* **Open Source**
  * The code should be freely available and observe the four freedoms of open-source software.
